        <p> 
             This animal has a elongated body and relatively short limbs. The tail, which is longer than half the body length is fluffly and reaches the ground. <br/>
            The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and relatively long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but it is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms.<br />
            Red foxes either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with no fixed abode. <br/>
            They primarily feed on small rodents like voles, mice, ground squirrels, hamsters, gerbils <br /> <br /> <br />
