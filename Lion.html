            These animals usually live in grasslands, scrubs, or open woodland areas. Usually they can be found in the sub-Saharan African region. <br />
            Unlike cats, who don't stay in groups, Lions perfer to stay in groups called Prides. They stick together usually when its time to hunt or share meals. <br/>
            The group could contain as little as 4 members or as big as 37 members.  The lions usually eat on animals varying in sizes. <br/>
            They can eat rodents, baboons, buffalo, or even hippopotamuses. But they get medium sized creatures more often usually. <br/> <br /> <br />
